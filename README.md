This repository was part of the "Village de la Data", a hackathon about Data Science.

What is a Pulsar star :

    A Pulsar is a highly magnetazed rotating neutron star that emits a beam of electromagnetic radiation.
    This radiation can be observed only when the beam of emission is pointing toward Earth.

Data meaning :

    Integrated Profile :

        Curve of the star's periodics electromagnetic pulsations

    DM-SNR :
        DM (Dispersion Measure) are the value of the integrated profile curve stretched or squeezed

        SNR (Signal to Noise ratio) is a measure used to compare the level of a desired signal to the level of background noise

        They make a curve out of both of these values

    Class :
        Type of the pulsar star

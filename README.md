# Pulsar Star

This repository was part of the "Village de la Data", a hackathon about Data Science.

We mainly used python for this, with the help of libs like "sickit learn" for the machine learning part of the project, "matplotlib" and "seaborn" were used to display graphs

What is a Pulsar star :
    A Pulsar is a highly magnetazed rotating neutron star that emits a beam of electromagnetic radiation. This radiation can be observed only when the beam of emission is pointing toward Earth. [More Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar)
